The files in this directory are those you'll need to participate in
inaugural the Code Quarterly Code Challenge which you can read about
here: http://www.codequarterly.com/code-challenges/markup/

  - instructions.txt: Instructions for this challenge.

  - markup-spec.txt: The Markup specification

  - tests/: a bunch of test cases you can use to test your
    implementation. (Additionally all the .txt files in this directory
    as well as this README are examples of real-world Markup files.)

  - terms.txt: The fine print you’ll have to agree to before you
    submit your code.

When you’re done, you can submit your code here:

  http://www.codequarterly.com/code-challenges/markup/submit.html

On that page, after agreeing to the legal terms, you’ll can either
upload an archive (tar.gz or zip) containing your code or the URL of a
commit on a publicly available GitHub repository.
